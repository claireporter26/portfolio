            <p class="skillstext">I currently have basic skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and am improving my skills every day. I have designed a few 
    websites already and enjoy the challenge that comes with learning new techniques</p>
            </br>

    <div id="skill1"></div>
    <h4>HTML5</h4>
    <p>HTML online courses are where I started learning web development. I have then used this knowledge to help me learn further skills, each time using some HTML as the base. 
        Because of this I understand how important this is.</p>

    
</br>
    <div id="skill2"></div>
    <h4>CSS</h4>
    <p>From the basic HTML skills I then moved onto learning CSS. This quickly became one of my favourite languages 
        as it had the ability to change basic text into colourful designs with great layouts.</p>

    
</br>
    <div id="skill3"></div>
    <h4>Javascript</h4>
    <p>Javascript is a programming language that I am still working on improving. I have done a few online courses, through YouTube, 
        Skillshare and currently through Codecademy and am enjoying improving my skills in this area.</p>

    
</br>
    <div id="skill4"></div>
    <h4>jQuery</h4>
    <p>jQuery has made Javascript functionality available to me while I continue to study. Although I still have more to learn and know there is 
        functionality I haven't yet tried I understand the basics enough to be able to use it with some research.</p>
 
    
</br>
    <div id="skill5"></div>
    <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
    <p>Bootstrap is my latest skill to learn and it has allowed my 
        portfolio to become responsive in a short amount of time. I am enjoying seeing how flexible it can be and see how it 
        is such a useful tool for fast website building.</p>
